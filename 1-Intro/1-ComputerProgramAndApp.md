A **program** is a set of instructions that are developed to work in a single platform and written by a programmer in a programming language (C++, Java, Python, etc.)

**Applications** (apps) are designed for end-user to perform specific tasks and achieve their purpose as well as can manipulate text, numbers, graphics, audio, and combination of these elements, etc. Shortly, apps are programs designed for end-users. Often people mean by app only the apps that run on the mobile devices and programs they call the apps that run on the computers.

The app is always designed for the end-user. If the software is not for the end-user then it is a program. If the app is designed for example for Windows, OSx, or Linux then it may be called a program, too although designed for the end-user.
