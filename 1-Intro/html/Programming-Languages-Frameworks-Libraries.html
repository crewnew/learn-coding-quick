<h1 data-pm-slice="1 3 []"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Programming Languages, Frameworks, Libraries</span></h1>

<p data-pm-slice="1 3 []"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>JS (JavaScript)</strong> - the way most popular scripting language for web apps and websites. But can be today used also to develop mobile apps (<strong>React Native</strong> for example) or desktop apps (<strong>ElectronJS</strong> for example). It is also one of the oldest languages developed by Netscape back in 1995. Alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>NodeJS</strong> - runtime environment to run JS on server-side. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, and back in old days due to that Node was the only one with what you could make SPAs due to that. It&#39;s built on Chrome&#39;s V8 JS engine. Node is the latest in a long line of &ldquo;Are you cool enough to use me?&rdquo; programming techs. Most popular Node frameworks are:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>ExpressJS</strong> that are used by Uber &amp; Twitter and is the most popular one. It&#39;s easy to learn and has helpful tools for speed, response, and performance improvement. Has a nice integration with SQL and NoSQL DB. ExpressJs do not follow any specific pattern (eg. <strong>MVC</strong> - model, view, controller). You are free to structure your project as you wish. Almost the standard for Node.js web middleware but as your codebase size increases, refactoring becomes very challenging.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>MeteorJS</strong> - MVC framework. It is much liked by full-stack devs who want to do everything on their own as in Meteor you are using the same code on both - server &amp; client sides. The framework supports OS X, Windows, and Linux. Its reactive programming model allows you to build applications with less JavaScript. Suitable for MVP development and prototype. Smart packages: you may use a single command to connect multiple features. Developers who like Meteor are usually good developers who like simple and elegant code.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>KoaJS</strong> - by the same team behind Express, and aims to be smaller, more expressive, and more robust. Knowing Koa is again a sign of a more intelligent dev because good devs like lightweight, a good user experience, and better error handling through try/catch. Koa allows simply writing functions instead of spamming middleware.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>HapiJS</strong> - security focus Node framework. Code quality and verification are prioritized over extensive functionality.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>AngularJS</strong> - the first modern JS framework. When Google came out with AngularJS then that was the game-changer and all modern developers started using it. It is still used a lot and there are many Angular developers out there. It is a bit more complex than others so developers good at Angular are usually good ones and can quickly pick up easily learnable Vue but also React. The problem why people didn&#39;t like Angular back then and why React was developed was that Google came out with a new version of Angular too often so the web apps needed re-factoring and devs needed to constantly learn new stuff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>ReactJS</strong> - the number one JS front-end library today and passed big time Angular around 2017 already. It is developed by Facebook and has also the biggest amount of developers and projects out there. To identify a good React developer you want to hear how good they are in <strong>NextJS</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Redux</strong> - open-source JS state container designed to help you write JS apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. Most commonly used with React but also with Angular. You want your good React dev to know Redux. Many juniors start with <strong>Gatsby</strong> instead that is way easier but has its limitations to build more complex apps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>VueJS</strong> - progressive open-source JS front-end framework. Preferred more than React by many and has many advantages over React but also cons. There&#39;s not really any clear answer should you pick today Vue or React. We usually do it for new projects depending on whether we have more free resources in React or Vue. A good Vue dev should for sure be also good at <strong>NuxtJS</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Svelte</strong> - open-source front-end compiler. Apps do not include a framework script so it&#39;s a radical new approach to building UIs. It&#39;s much better than popular ones in many ways but using what was taught to you at school and what is used by everybody else is like a religion. Good things in most cases remain some geeky hackers&#39; cup of tea. Svelte devs usually are intelligent and hope it will be more popular one day. It is hard to find Svelte devs and projects but as it&#39;s good it is not hard to sell it to customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>jQuery</strong> - fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. Was many years industry standard for MPA (multi-page app) development. Is still super widely used but it is old-fashioned today. Dev advertising that I&#39;m good at jQuery is not here in modern world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Elm</strong> - functional programming language that compiles to JS. lm uses type inference to detect corner cases and give friendly hints. NoRedInk switched to Elm about four years ago, and 300k+ lines later, they still have not had to scramble to fix a confusing runtime exception in production. Another beautiful thing out there but same as Svelte not many use it and not many devs out there and the community of Elm devs is super friendly and very intelligent. <a href="https://medium.com/crewnew-com/hasura-api-engine-elm-lets-go-bug-free-rapid-app-development-4f9630280d72" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://medium.com/crewnew-com/hasura-api-engine-elm-lets-go-bug-free-rapid-app-development-4f9630280d72">More about Elm&gt;&gt;</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">It used to be easy to find FE dev and harder BE dev back in old days and there were many many good full-stack devs out there but since modern and complex FE frameworks like React the FE is really rocket science not just making some pixels look like in the design so finding a good FE could be sometimes even bit more complex than BE. <a href="https://medium.com/crewnew-com/front-end-development-frameworks-and-languages-83e47f135d3f" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://medium.com/crewnew-com/front-end-development-frameworks-and-languages-83e47f135d3f">More about FE frameworks&gt;&gt;</a></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>TS (TypeScript)</strong> - a programming language by Microsoft and used with JS - the goal of TS is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JS development less buggy and efficient. For JS dev not knowing TS shows that the dev is not that good. Not always of course but it&#39;s a signal. And being good in TS means there&#39;s a higher chance that the dev is good in whatever JS framework you&#39;re hiring so it&#39;s often good to use also &quot;typescript&quot; as a keyword when searching for JS devs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>PHP</strong> - used to be for many decades the number one programming &amp; scripting language for the server-side for web apps but since <strong>NodeJS</strong> JavaScript is beating even PHP when we talk about starting new projects from scratch. But there are tons of web apps developed in PHP during the past years. Also, most of the above-mentioned ready-made softwares including all those WP, Woo, Drupal, Magento, etc., etc. back-ends are written in PHP. Finding a PHP developer is very easy these days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Laravel</strong> - the number one PHP framework. All the modern PHP devs know it and know that Laravel is #1 for many years already. If PHP is dev&#39;s main language and some other framework that Laravel (eg. <strong>CodeIgniter</strong>, <strong>Symfony</strong>, <strong>Zend</strong>, <strong>Yii, CakePHP</strong>, etc.). Of course, older PHP devs should know those, too as Laravel gained huge popularity around 2014. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0jwy148,%2Fm%2F09cjcl,%2Fm%2F02qgdkj,%2Fm%2F05zvgrd,Zend" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0jwy148,%2Fm%2F09cjcl,%2Fm%2F02qgdkj,%2Fm%2F05zvgrd,Zend">See trends&gt;&gt;</a> <strong>Phalcon</strong> is one not-so-popular PHP framework that is built for speed. It is delivered as a web server extension written in <strong>C</strong>. Knowing this shows also that dev doesn&#39;t just pick the most popular but when possible to choose the stack thinks how to do things smarter. Also, <strong><a href="https://lumen.laravel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://lumen.laravel.com/">Lumen</a></strong> is worth mentioning as a lightweight version of Laravel. Good devs like speed and simplicity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Python</strong> - used by gigants like Google, Yahoo!, NASA, and many others. Its design philosophy emphasises code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++, Java, or PHP. It is very popular and there are really many developers, too although already a bit harder to find compared to JS &amp; PHP. But still, Python, JavaScript, and PHP are all the leading programming or scripting languages in the World. It&#39;s probably a number one language for machine learning, big data, data scraping, and also server-side scripting. Developing a back-end for a mobile or web app in one of the popular Python frameworks like <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>FastAPI</strong> or <strong>Django</strong> is possible but often not preferred because it is more time-consuming and heavy. Python is considered sometimes slow, having runtime errors, high memory consumption, and limited data access.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>MEAN</strong> - JS stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>MERN</strong> - JS stack:&nbsp;MongoDB, Express, React, Node</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>LAMP</strong> - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. Old stack. These days instead of Apache at most cases Nginx is used. Linux is anyway standard and doesn&#39;t need to be mentioned. Or Cloud service is used.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>.NET</strong> - Microsoft&#39;s&nbsp;developer platform with tools and libraries for building any type of app, including web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, cloud, and microservices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Java</strong> - an old big player and still popular and taught in universities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>C#</strong> - by Microsoft and primarily for its .NET framework. It is used a lot by Windows devs and game devs but also used for server-side apps. It has a rich set of libraries that makes it a faster and efficient language.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>C/C++</strong> - old goodies that will remain with us forever? System-level programming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Rust</strong> - new better C++ with better memory handling for example. Gaining a lot of popularity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Go</strong> - during the last few years, Go has gained a lot of popularity among devs. Stack Overflow reports Go in the top 5 most loved languages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>R</strong> - Various big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Uber, etc are using the R language for their businesses and considering the rapidly increasing demand for data science and machine learning trends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Ruby</strong> - Python, and Ruby tried to be the new and popular hipe languages to learn around the first decade but although Rubi isn&#39;t a bad language and a lot is done in it - obviously, Python is the winner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Kotlin</strong> -&nbsp;cross-platform, modern programming language. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin&#39;s standard library depends on the Java Class Library.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Swift</strong> - native iOS apps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Scala</strong> - Netflix, LinkedIn, eBay, Twitter, etc. are using Scala. Easy to learn. It has some cool features like lazy computation, string interpolation, type inference and great scalability.</span></p>

<h6><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Other Terms / Skills</span></h6>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Skills</strong> - how we call in CN everything you can do. Programming language, software, tool, design app, server practice, etc. etc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>UX</strong> - User experience design / plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>CI/CD</strong> - Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipelines</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>TDD</strong> - Test Driven Development. Spend in the beginning some times to write tests to win later time on de-bugging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Unit testing</strong> -&nbsp;software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Micro Services</strong> -&nbsp;is a architecture that enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. Eg. user registration, lost passwords, login, SSO etc. could be one micro service. Modifing&nbsp;one micro service&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Scrum</strong> - Agile Development methology where there&#39;s 1 or 2 week&#39;s time (sprint) tasks planned and then plan during the sprint is not allowed to change until the sprint is over and then new sprint tasks are planned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>ER Diagram</strong> -&nbsp;entity relationship diagram (ERD), also known as an entity relationship model, is a graphical representation that depicts relationships among people, objects, places, concepts or events within an information technology (IT) system.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>SRS</strong> - Software Requirement Specification. Includes also usually flows, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVKGgOeouk8&amp;t=82s" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVKGgOeouk8&amp;t=82s">wireframes</a> and later also ER Diagram.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>NoCode / LowCode</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;No-code is typically used to create tactical apps to handle simple functions. Low-code can be used in those cases as well, but additionally to create apps that run processes that are critical to a business or to an organization&#39;s core systems, such as certain integrations and digital transformation initiatives.</span></p>
