<h1 class="ck ck-title">Ask for a contact to get a reference</h1>

<p>Even better if the reference comes with a brilliant piece of code.</p>

<p>Always be clear on exactly what you need.&nbsp;Like that you are avoiding the back-and-forth messaging and saving time. The quicker the hiring process the higher the chances that the candidate gives up and the customer gets upset. Ask for: Full name and job title of the reference. Necessary contact information for reference.</p>

<p><strong>aText:</strong> .refcan <em>(reference from the candidate)</em></p>

<p>Your code looked nice and we&#39;re happy to move forward with you. Thank you very much for your efforts so far! We&rsquo;d like to move to the final&nbsp;stage now so could you provide please me with preferably 2-3 references of yours? It would be nice if you could send me the names, reporting relationships and contact details of your former managers/colleagues.</p>

<h2 class="ck ck-title2">Ask the reference</h2>

<p><strong>aText:</strong> .refbos&nbsp;<em>(reference from the previous boss)</em></p>

<p><strong>Subject line:</strong>&nbsp;Could you provide a reference for [<em>Candidate_name</em>]?</p>

<p>Hello [<em>Name</em>],</p>

<p>My name is [<em>your name</em>] and I work for CrewNew Ltd. We&rsquo;re in the process of hiring for a [<em>job title</em>] and one of your former colleagues, [<em>Candidate_name</em>], has successfully passed all our recruiting phases.</p>

<p>Before we make the final decision, I&rsquo;d like to ask for some information to ensure we&rsquo;re making the right choice. I&rsquo;m reaching out to you because [<em>Candidate_name] </em>pointed to you as a potential reference<em>.</em>&nbsp;It&rsquo;d be very useful if you could tell me a bit about your overall experience working with [<em>Candidate_name</em>] and whether you&rsquo;d recommend the co-operation.</p>

<p>Could I call you for a brief discussion today or tomorrow? If you&rsquo;d rather send me information via email, feel free to do so.</p>

<p>Of course, our communication is confidential.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help,</p>
