<h1><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Hosting</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Shared hosting</strong> - Eg. FastComer, GoDaddy, etc. You have very limited access and in one machine there are many customers&#39; solutions. One can&#39;t break another one as there is no root access via SSH for example to install software, reboot machine etc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>VPS</strong> - virtual private server. Eg. DigitalOcean, UpCloud, Vutlr etc. Feels like you have your private machine that you can install whatever OS you wish, reboot it, do what you want. Shut it down when you want. But actually there&#39;s in a bigger machine just virtually created multiple machines thus VPS is much cheaper than dedicated machine. In DigitalOcean one VPS (they call it droplet) costs $5pcm for example.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Dedicated Server</strong> - Eg. Hetzner. Most amount of compute power for your buck if you need to have lot of RAM and CPU for example. You get for example full machine with 64/128GB RAM and lot of CPU power with less than &euro;100 so if you need that mucn power it&#39;s much cheaper. But you need a server admin or DevOps then, too who will keep all that working.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><strong>Cloud</strong> - Eg, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure. Not a machine where you install OS and start then installing or developing services but rather some ready made services. Eg. AWS S3 is for a simple cloud storage. You have your API and you can store and read stored media. In a similar way there are tons of cloud services offered.</span></p>
