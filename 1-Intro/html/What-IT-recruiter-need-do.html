<ol data-pm-slice="3 3 []">
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Review Requirements &amp; Create JD</span></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Review the JD&nbsp;(job description) to understand who exactly is needed: what skills and at what level, what experience, what is the salary, what is the job about, what are the bonuses, etc.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Create a job post that is attractive and possibly IP filtered to Eastern Europe. Make sure the JD has also some sample work for devs to estimate the min/max amount of hrs of work. What developers like about one <a href="https://cms.crewnew.com/admin/collections/job_posts/2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://cms.crewnew.com/admin/collections/job_posts/2">great company&gt;&gt;</a></span></p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Post the JD &amp; Cold Message</span></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Post the JD to many places. Really many. First to the ones that have a higher &quot;Hire Rate&quot; score in <a href="https://cms.crewnew.com/admin/collections/external_sources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://cms.crewnew.com/admin/collections/external_sources">External Sources</a> and then also the ones that have not so high rate. Try to find with every hire also some new places and add them to External Sources. Rate the sources and keep the table up to date. Remember to google &quot;Skill&quot; + &quot;Community&quot; (eg. Rust community) to find specific language/framework/etc specific community forums, chats, etc.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Cold Message in LinkedIn and other social media sites. Cold email. Cold SMS. Invite people to apply and write to people personally. Contact also people already in ATS. Not so nicely said: spam.&nbsp;Spam a lot!</span></p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Get them apply and test</span></p>

	<ol>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Get all the candidates to apply to ATS - applicant tracking system: <a href="https://crnw.uk/ats" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="https://crnw.uk/ats">crnw.uk/ats</a> via apply.crewnew.com?p=1111&amp;f=app-1111&amp;q=1-2-3 - if they haven&#39;t applied after some time then add them yourself manually using the same URL. Then you can already send them apply.crewnew.com/step2/t=000000000 URL. Contact them by adding in LI, checking if their mobile nr is WhatsApp by URL wa.me/+00000000, email, other social media.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Get the candidate to take the test. To help recruiters assess the skills of developers and software engineers, CN skill test if available or HackerRank creates coding and technical assessments that help in evaluating developers eliminating biases and promoting diversity. Pymetrics is another platform that uses a gamified neuroscience approach coupled with bias-free algorithms to map the right candidate. They are run on a series of behavior-based games that collect millions of data points for objectively measuring cognitive and personality traits. On one hand, it maximizes prediction through customized and automated machine learning algorithms, and on the other hand Pymetrics also automatically matches the rejected candidate pool to their other clients using the same platform.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Follow up with the ones who haven&#39;t replied after 1-2 working days. Keep your candidates in the loop. This goes a long way to build your credibility and keep your candidates either coming back to you or sending referrals to you. IMPORTANT!</span></p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Make the data in the ATS complete</span></p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Freelancer comment: Is he/she a freelancer, full/half/part-time, working somewhere already full-time? Happy to do how many hrs? Looking to leave the current company?</span></p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Skills - make sure all the required skills are added + skills you find from the person&#39;s LI (LinkedIn), freelancer sites, GitHub, etc. Make sure they are rated, added since when experience, and also some comments are suggested to be there.</span></p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">In the comments, we add what channel was used to contact, what&#39;s the state of the candidate, some extra info sent, some samples of code. Check their GitHub and add to comments if no repos regarding the language for example they applied. Make sure their own repos, how many commits, how many stars. English level. Personality.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">ManagerID: your ID so you earn when hired.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Add rates. Minimum hours = 80 when half-time and 160 for example often when full-time. Currency in most cases US Dollar. Comment could be &quot;profile&quot; when taken from some external profile or &quot;quoted&quot; when a person quoted that in chat for example.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Under &quot;Social&quot; add GitHub, StackOverflow, LI, freelancer sites, personal website, whatever you find new about the person.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Contacts: email, mobile, and some IM (instant messenger) should be for everybody eg.: WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, Viber, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.</span></p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Make the initial video interview with top JR (job rating) people and record it. Add to comments the English spoken level &amp; other comments how did you feel about the person. Often people say they can&#39;t share their sample of code so they will demo during the interview. Let them tell you their quick history in IT career, what they study at the moment and where they see themselves in 1/5 years. Ask all the info still missing from ATS.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">At #recruitment channel ask the top players you interviewed to be checked the code by some lead developer and if they like what they see then they will do the technical interview and possibly live pair coding session.</span></p>
