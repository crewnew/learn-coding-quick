# OBJECT and ARRAY:

In the sample.js the `someVariable` is an object and inside that object we have two properties: `propery_one` and `propery_two` that holds an array. The array consists of three objects.

I want to get now the third object from the array at `property_two` (as in programming languages the first object is 0 and the second is 1 and I have put 2 there) and from that object I want to get the property named `one` and I expect to get the result as "three_one".
